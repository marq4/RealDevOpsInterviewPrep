* Situation: 
	+ Linux "box" (VM) disk space 100% full. 
	+ And it's unusable because a message is printed to screen every second. 

* Task: Resolve situation. 


* Theory questions: 
	1.- How do we stop messages on a "chatty" terminal? 
	2.- What if commands can't even be typed in at all? 
	3.- How do we monitor disk usage in real time? 
	4.- What happens if you type sudo password incorrectly many times in a row? 
	5.- In general, how would you prevent something like this from happening again? 


* Setup: 
	1.- Follow the same steps as intermediate challenge but with: 
		+ $ sudo bash fill_disk3.sh 
		+ $ sudo bash /opt/myapp/runaway.sh 
	2.- Open a separate terminal to investigate. 
	# To pause messages just <Ctrl>+C on the first terminal. 

* Cleanup: 
	# Note: these resources are also used for: 
	#	- Disk intermediate challenge. 
	# 	- Service challenge. 
	#	- Firewalls challenge. 
	+ Delete ISO. 
	+ Uninstall VirtualBox.
