* Situation: Linux "box" (container) taking too much disk space. 
* Task: Find and delete unnecessary, large files. 
* Goal: Reduce disk usage by ~1GB. 

* Note: Disk will not show as >90% full or so due to limitations with WSL. 

* Theory questions: 
	+ Linux:
		1.- What files do we usually delete to clear disk space? 
		2.- How do we see disk usage? 
		3.- How do we find large files? 
		4.- How do we list files by modification date-time? 
		5.- How do we know which files are safe to remove? 
	+ Docker: 
		6.- What is "overlay" filesystem? 
		7.- What is this: 
			/sys/devices/LNXSYSTM/LNXSYBUS:00/ACPI0004/VMBUS/dbe...cba/pci09.../resource4? 
		8.- Is there a way to tell if a directory is shared with the host (Bind Mount) from inside the container? 

* Setup: 
	1.- Start Docker Desktop. 
	2.- $ cd LabEnv 
	3.- $ docker build --tag disk-lab:basic . 
	4.- $ winpty docker run -it --rm disk-lab:basic 

* Cleanup: 
	+ $ docker image remove --force disk-lab:basic 
	+ $ docker image list --format "{{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}}"
