* Execution: 
	+ Amazon Linux: 
		- Log into the AWS Console. 
		- Launch EC2 instance. 
		- SSH (ec2-user) or EC2 Instance Connect. 
		- $ which firewalld 
			# no firewalld 
		- $ sudo dnf install -y firewalld 
		- $ sudo systemctl start firewalld 
		- $ sudo firewall-cmd --list-all 
		# Incoming 8080/tcp+udp blocked by default. 
		- Explicitly block it: 
			' $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" port port="8080" protocol="tcp" drop' 
			' $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" port port="8080" protocol="udp" drop' 
		- Allow 443: 
			' $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https 
			' $ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
			' $ sudo firewall-cmd --list-all 

	+ Ubuntu (WSL: Windows Subsystem for Linux): 
		- Execute ubuntu.exe. 
		- $ which ufw 
			# (Nothing.) 
		- $ sudo apt install -y ufw 
		- $ sudo ufw enable 
		- List rules: 
			' $ sudo ufw status 
		- Deny: 
			' $ sudo ufw deny 8080 
			' $ sudo ufw deny 8080/udp 
		- Allow: 
			' $ sudo ufw allow https 
			' $ sudo ufw status 


* Answers: 
	1.- Why do these distros use different tools? 
	     Ans: | 
		+ Due to historical reasons & different philosophies. 
		+ UFW was specifically built for Ubuntu for simplicity. 
		+ Firewalld: enterprise-grade, dynamic, zone-aware. 

	2.- What happens if one is already installed and you try to install the other? 
	     Ans: | 
		+ Ubuntu: 
			- UFW is the default, user-friendly, lightweight FW mgmt tool. 
			- Firewalld is more complex but STILL compatible. 
			- Using both would cause conflict and unexpected behavior. 
		+ Amazon Linux 2023 doesn't support EPEL, so UFW cannot be (easily) installed. 

	3.- What FW would you install & configure for use in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Docker container? 
	     Ans: | 
		+ Trick question - containers don't need a firewall. 
		+ Netw security is handled by the host's FW and Docker's netw isolation. 

	4.- In this challenge we focus on the 2 most relevant protocols primarily used by FWs. 
	     Suppose a developer codes a server that binds to both protocols, but the 
	     SysAdmin only blocks one, could that be a security issue? 
	     Ans: Yes. 
		+ If developer writes a server that binds to both TCP and UDP, 
		+ But FW is set to only block TCP, 
			# sudo ufw deny 9999/tcp 
		+ A security gap is created:  
			$ netcat -u server-name 9999 	# Still works! 
		+ Real-world example: DNS (port 53, both protos). 
			An attacker could exfiltrate data via DNS tunneling. 

	5.- What happens to the rules if you uninstall the FW? 
	     Ans: | 
		+ The underlying iptables rules remain active. 
		+ FW Linux stack: 
			1.- User-friendly tools (wrappers): UFW, Firewalld. 
			2.- CLIs: iptables, nftables. 
			3.- Netfilter: Linux kernel FW framework; actual packet filtering. 

	6.- The FIRST thing we do as quickly as possible after launching an EC2 instance is 
	     configure the FW via EC2 Instance Connect to prevent security breaches? 
	     Ans: False. 
		+ The FIRST thing we actually do is ensure SGs are correctly configured 
		    BEFORE launch. Host FWs can come later for defense-in-depth. 
		+ In AWS, Security Groups are stateful and handle most cases well. 
		+ We may add Firewalld for: 
			- Compliance. 
			- Interface-specific rules. 
			- Outbound filtering.
