* Instructions to set up a practice environment: 
	+ Start Docker Desktop. 
	+ Launch Project and connect to container: 				# Takes ~10m (first time). 
		- $ cd LabEnv/ 
		- $ docker compose up -d 
		- $ winpty docker compose exec lab bash 
		# Verify: 
		- $ java -version 
		- $ mvn -version 
		- $ docker --version 
		- $ docker compose version 
	+ Write your practice notes under a new folder <DATE> inside PracticeNotes/. 
	+ Write your practice Docker files inside the lab container under /workspace/practice/<DATE>. 


* Task: 
	+ Containerize given Spring Boot application by writing: 
		- Dockerfile: (build &) run app. 
		- Docker Compose: orchestrate: app + DB. 

* Approaches: 
	+ Basic: build jar outside Docker, container only runs app. 
	+ Advanced: multi-stage build. 


* Specifications: 
	+ Application port: 8080. 
	+ Java version: 11. 
	+ PostgreSQL version: 16. 


* Validate exercise completion: 
	+ Health endpoint: http://localhost:8080/api/products/health 
	    should return/show success message. 




* Theory questions: 
	# What you NEED to know: 

	1.- How is a JAR executed/run? 

	2.- How is a Java Spring Boot application built with Maven?

	3.- If tests fail, for example if the DB is not available, how are tests bypassed (to just build the artifact(s))? 

	4.- Where are resulting artifacts placed when build completes?

	5.- How would you exclude all text files and the target folder from being copied during 
	     Docker build without modifying the Dockerfile? 

	6.- In Docker, what are: 
		+ Bind mounts? 
		+ Named volumes? 

	7.- How do we see what Docker Compose is doing in real-time? 

	8.- What's the difference between ENTRYPOINT and CMD in a Dockerfile? 
	       When would you use each?

	9.- For a Docker base image for a Java/Spring project, what are: 
		+ One that's easy to remember? 
		+ The recommended one?
	    # Base images "java", "openjdk" are deprecated. 

	10.- Where does PostgreSQL store its data by default? 

	11.- What are the default values PostgreSQL uses for: 
		+ DB name. 
		+ Superuser. 
		+ Password. 

	12.- What can you say about building the JAR outside Docker, then just execute it as a container, 
	       VS multi-stage Build with Docker?

	# Nice to know (extra): 

	13.- What would you do if: 
		+ You were given the URL for the repo. 
		+ You were tasked with working on "system" branch only. 
		+ You were told that the repo is HUGE and downloading it all would simply take TOO LONG. 

	14.- How do we monitor Docker's resource usage in real-time? 

	15.- What is Maven? 

	16.- What is POM? 

	17.- How would you back up a named volume that a running postgres container is using? 



* Cleanup: 
	+ Inner Docker resources must be deleted inside Docker-On-Docker: 
		- $ pwd 
		  # /workspace/practice/... 
		- $ docker compose down -v --rmi all 
	+ And then the outer lab environment on Windows Git Bash: 
		- $ docker compose down -v --rmi local 
		- $ rm -rf SpringBootChallengeCode/AppSrc/target/ 
		- $ rm -rf SpringBootChallengeCode/PracticeCode/<DATE>/Advanced/src/ 
		- $ rm -rf SpringBootChallengeCode/PracticeCode/<DATE>/Advanced/pom.xml 
		- $ rm -rf SpringBootChallengeCode/PracticeCode/<DATE>/Basic/*.jar
