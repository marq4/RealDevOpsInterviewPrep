* Tips: 
	+ CAUTION: If you delete a file in the container under 
		- /workspace/app, 
		- /workspace/practice, 
	    it is also gone in your host (Windows)! 
	+ Don't try to COPY the jar into the container from ../../ (Dockerfile), simply copy it over to practice folder. 
	+ You don't need to know the default port number that PostgreSQL uses, Docker will select it by default. 
	+ For the app to run correctly, 3 env vars are needed. Look into the properties file for hints 
	   (and to get the values obviously). 
	+ Either curl from Git Bash or just access the URL from your web browser, NOT from the inner container. 
	+ If you see: 
		Whitelabel Error Page, 404 
	   - Verify the URL (you may be trying http://localhost:8080), but it has to be:
		http://localhost:8080/api/products/health 
	+ If you examine the lab's Compose YAML you'll notice that both AppSrc/ and PracticeCode/ folders 
	   have been mounted into the container. These are Bind Mounts and it means that any files there can be 
	   edited with VS Code in Windows.
