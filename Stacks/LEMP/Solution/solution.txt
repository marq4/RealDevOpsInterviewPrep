* Technical execution:

* Theory: 
	1.- What does LEMP stand for: 
		Ans: Linux, (E)Nginx, MySQL, PHP. 
	2.- Why not LAMP: 
		Ans: 
		- Nginx handles concurrent connections way better than Apache 
	     	   by using an event-driven architecture. 
	     	- For high-traffic sites it is more efficient and uses less memory. 
	3.- What does it mean for nginx to be a "reverse proxy": 
		Ans: 
		- A reverse proxy sits in front of our backend servers. 
		- Clients think they're talking directly to server, but actually hitting the proxy. 
		- This allows us to do: 
			' Load Balancing. 
			' SSL termination. 
			' Caching. 
			' Hide backend topology. 
		- Conversely, a regular proxy protects clients (human employees at office). 
	4.- How do we see what is using a port in Ubuntu: 
		Ans: $ sudo apt install -y iproute2 && ss -tulnip 
	5.- What would be different in a physical or VM server: 
		Ans: 
		- We'd use sudo instead of logging in as root. 
		- Manage Apache with systemctl (which shouldn't run on a container):
			' $ systemctl disable --now apache2 
	6.- What is FPM: 
		Ans: FastCGI Process Manager allows Nginx to talk to PHP. 
	7.- What is TCP: 
		Ans: 
		- Transmission Control Protocol: connection-oriented, reliable. 
		- Guarantees "packet" [segment] delivery with acknowledgements, ordering, & retransmission. 
		- Used for HTTP, SSH, email. 
		- OSI, TCP/IP (5) Layer: 4: Transport (TCP + UDP). 
	8.- What is HTTP:
		Ans:
		- HyperText Transfer Protocol: Application layer protocol browsers 
		   use to request & receive web content. 
		- Runs on top of TCP (usually ports 80, 443 for HTTPSecure). 
		- Request-response based: client asks for a resource (like index.html), 
		   server responds with headers + content.
